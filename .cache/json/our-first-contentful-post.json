Sparkes (Assistant Clerk)\t</p>\n<p>One member of the public.\n(1)     Chairman’s Opening Remarks and Apologises for Absence:</p>\n<p>The Chairman welcomed everyone to the meeting and asked for apologies for absence. These were recorded as Paul Hornibrook – Clerk (Illness), Cllr. S. Dungay (Illness), Cllr. R. Mallett (Illness), Cllr. R. Thomas CCC (Planning Meeting), and KCC Cllr. J. Simmonds (Illness).</p>\n<p>The Chairman introduced Miss Chenice Sparkes and Ms A. Sparkes who have been undertaking the Parish Council clerical duties in the absence of Mr P. Hornibrook who has been unwell.</p>\n<p>(2)     Confirmation of previous Minutes of the last meeting held 28th November 2017:\nCllr Frost proposed and Cllr Coles seconded, and all councillors voted in favour, that the Minutes of the parish council meeting held on 28th November 2017 (previously circulated) be accepted as a true record of the meeting and the Chairman duly signed them. </p>\n<p>(3)     Council: a) Declaration of any councillor’s interest in agenda items.\nNo interest in any Agenda item was noted by any Councillor.</p>\n<p>Declaration of Disclosable Pecuniary Interests and Other Significant Interests and Voluntary Announcements of Other Interests, and a reminder to think of any changes to the DPI Register held at CCC, such as a change of job or home.\nCllr.

Wells.</p>\n<p>Miss Sparkes reported that the Canterbury City Council Policy and Resources Committee met on 13th December 2017 to consider a report on the first stage of consultation on the Community Governance Review. The Councillors resolved with a  vote of nine in favour and two abstaining that:\nWith a very low 450 total responses from the whole district, there was insufficient             desire from residents nor a mandate to proceed or pursue the creation of Town             Councils for the unparished areas of Whitstable, Herne Bay and Canterbury.\nFurther improved Area Member Panel (AMP) arrangements should be explored,              and possibly extend their powers. (The AMPS are advisory committees – not              decision making bodies, and this is not likely to change.)\nThe recommendations and options for individual parished areas go out to further             public consultation. Chartham Parish Council has no recommended changes.</p>\n<p>The next step is for the Chairman of the working group (Cllr Ben Fitter-Harding) and the City Council’s Chief Executive to design the next stage of public consultation on the further options for rural / parished areas. The working group will then make any further recommendations. </p>\n<p> (6)    Financial Matters, including ‘Authorisation of Accounts’:\nSchedule of payments - A resolution that orders for payment as shown in attached schedules was agreed unanimously.

Funds could be allocated to projects under Parks and Gardens, Amenity Open Space, Fixed Play Areas, Outdoor Sports Facilities, and Semi Natural projects, and up to a possible combined total of £102,867.68. This amount is only an estimate, based on approximate developer contributions over the next few years.</p>\n<p>Cllr. Coles suggested that maintenance of Bakers Wood be put forward for funding and approaching the local Football Club to enquire whether their facilities need updating. The Chairman suggested putting forward the BMX track project and Cllr. Clark suggested new fencing around the Shalmsford Street Play Area. Miss Sparkes agreed to pass on the suggestions to Rebecca Booth.</p>\n<p>The Chairman reported that she had received a phonecall from Samantha at Kent County Council regarding £4,000 which has been allocated to the parish to be spent on adult social care capital projects e.g. access ramps, disabled toilets, signage, etc. As the majority of suggestions are already in place, the Parish Council resolved to request adult gym equipment at St Augustine’s.

Sparkes be officially employed on a part time basis at 15 hours a week while Mr P. Hornibrook is on sick leave.

Tombstones deemed unsafe or in need of repair have been carefully laid down to prevent any future damage, but residents unaware of this inspection have reported this to the Police and Councillors as vandalism. Cllr. Hoare reported that the usual practise is to tape up the tombstones and contact the owners giving them a year to rectify before then laying the tombstones down. </p>\n<p>Cllr. Hoare reported that the number of funerals was above average for 2017 – normally between 10-12 burials take place each year but in 2017 there were 15 burials and four internments of ashes. Cllr. Hoare also reported that he had received a request from Mr Richard Marsh, the gravedigger, requesting that funerals are not booked any later than 2.30pm in the winter months due to reduced daylight hours, as he will be filling in graves in the dark. The next funeral is scheduled for February.</p>\n<p>A matter of rates for an ex-resident being buried in the parish was raised. A long-standing resident of the parish had been living in a nursing home for two years but had lived in the parish for most of his life. Normally rates are doubled for anybody who has not lived in the parish for over a year but, as the resident had moved due to health reasons, it was suggested that the excess rates be removed in this instance. The Chairman deferred further discussions and a decision to the Cemetery meeting on 15th January 2018.\n\n(11)     Countryside Issues:</p>\n<p>Cllr. Coles reported that the pathway between the two fishing lakes opposite the Wyevale Garden Centre on Ashford Road has been blocked off since December 2017.

After some investigation, the circuit board was identified as being faulty and a replacement was ordered. This has now been delivered and the electrician has been informed.</p>\n<p>Cllr.

Butcher confirmed he has a key for the noticeboard and volunteered to remove the notices.</p>\n<p>Large hall hire charges have been increased from £15 to £20 per hour. The Chairman agreed to contact the website provider to get the website updated to reflect this change.\n\n(19)    Highway Matters:</p>\n<p>Cllr. Hoare reported that The Crescent will need to be closed in the near future to allow Kent Highways to resolve the sewer drain collapse.

A meeting was held recently on site to discuss the situation and Kent Highways will be applying for the necessary closure permits.</p>\n<p>Cllr. Clark reported that a number of residents have approached him interested in volunteering to undertake speed checks in the village. The Chairman reported that the equipment would need to be recalibrated before undertaking any checks and Cllr. Butcher confirmed that training of all volunteers would be required. Cllr, Butcher volunteered to assist with speed checks should a new volunteer group be resurrected.  There is an online registration and training requirement for any new volunteers in order that they be covered under the Kent Police insurance. </p>\n<pre><code>                                    Page 083 2017/2018\n\n                \n</code></pre>\n<p>(20) Reports from KCC Community Warden &#x26; Police Community Support Officer (PCSO): </p>\n<p>The following report was given from PCSO Gavin Dodwell for the period 01/12/2017 to 31/12/2017:\n\nCRIME RELATED INCIDENTS:\nCriminal Damage\nBurglary (various sheds)</p>\n<p>POLICE RELATED INCIDENTS\nNuisance Vehicle\nPSCO Nathan Mullins has now left to join the Police.
